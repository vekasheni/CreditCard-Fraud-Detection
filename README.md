# CreditCard-Fraud-Detection

  * In this project I have analyzed how many have **genuine transactions** and how many have **fraud transactions**.

  * This dataset contains **284807 rows Ã— 31 columns**.

  * Due to security concerns, the transaction details about the persons are not displayed. Instead it is displayed as V1,V2....etc.,

  * All the necessary Exploratory Data Analysis such as are done (Removing null values)
           
  * Here I have used **Decision tree and Random Forest model** to predict the accuracy of the transactions.

  * And also I have used **Normalization** to make the perfomance and accuracy of machine learning algorithms


# **Conclusion**

  * **Decision Tree Accuracy : 0.9987905664180609**
  * **Random Forest Accuracy : 0.999596855472687**
